    We design novel methods to do the task of Text
    Summarization using a class of sub-modular functions and clustering techniques. The sub-modular functions each combine two
    terms, one which encourages the summary to be representative of
    the corpus, and the other which positively rewards diversity. Our
    clustering techniques cluster similar types of sentences optimally.
