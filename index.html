# Document Summarization using Clustering and Submodular Functions

## What do we do ?
We design novel methods to do the task of Text
Summarization using a class of sub-modular functions and clustering techniques. The sub-modular functions each combine two
terms, one which encourages the summary to be representative of
the corpus, and the other which positively rewards diversity. Our
clustering techniques cluster similar types of sentences optimally.
