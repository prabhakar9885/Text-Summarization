			<strong>Document Summarization using Clustering and Submodular Functions</strong></h1>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>
			What do we do ?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				We design novel methods to do the task of Text Summarization using a class of sub-modular functions and clustering techniques.</li>
			<li>
				The sub-modular functions each combine two terms, one which encourages the summary to be representative of the corpus, and the other which positively rewards diversity.</li>
			<li>
				Our clustering techniques cluster similar types of sentences optimally.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>
			<strong>How did we geerate the summary from a collection of documents?</strong></h2>
		<p>
			Extractive text summarization process can be divided into two steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Pre Processing step and</li>
			<li>
				Processing step.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>
			Pre-Processing</h3>
		<p>
			In Pre-Processing is structured representation of the original text. It usually includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Sentences boundary identification. In English, sentence boundary is identified with presence of dot at the end of sentence.</li>
			<li>
				Stop-Word Elimination. Common words with no semantics and which do not aggregate relevant information to the task are eliminated.</li>
			<li>
				Stemming - The purpose of stemming is to obtain the stem or radix of each word, which emphasize its semantics.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Processing</h3>
		<p>
			In Processing step, the coverage and diversity measures are calculated for each sentence using their tf-idf scores. Then a weight-age is appropriately given to these parameters and the final score for a sentence is calculated. The top ranking sentences are selected for the final summary.</p>
